This project implements Pix2Pix, an image-to-image translation model using conditional GANs (cGANs). It learns to map input images (like sketches or edges) to target images (like photos). Trained on paired datasets, Pix2Pix generates realistic outputs and is widely used in image synthesis, style transfer, and data augmentation tasks.
